This is a repo for deep RL research.

Targeting environments with continuous action space.

Using existing libraries to learn from and build my own code base. 

Libraries used as a reference: 
    Stable Baselines3 - https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3
    OpenAI Spinning Up - https://github.com/openai/spinningup
    CleanRL - https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl

Thank you to these library developers for their hard work!
